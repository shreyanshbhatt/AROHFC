# Hybrid forecasting competition data analysis
The goal of this project is to generate a group of individual that can collectively make an accurate prediction.
For this, we have individual user's information in terms of the rational that a user has on making a decision. For test purposes, we also have their actual predictions.

The program uses word2vec and generates user representation based on the rationals.
